I share my presentation and @julietsvq's of the [Gapand 2017](https://gapand.com/) and [.NetMalaga 2017](http://dotnetmalaga.es/2017/)

We are not lazy, it is just... that... we support the energy savings.. don't you?
Do still you waste your energy turning the lights on with your hands, leaving the sofa? 

In this talk, we speak about simple (and cheap) projects to connect your home (or any gadget) to the cloud. 
We use few euros devices and cloud services.
